# Kaiqiang Zheng . Jarvis Consulting

I am a Software and AI Engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto and a Bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering from McMaster University, specializing in Applied AI, Software Development and Cloud Computing. As an AI Web Application Research Associate at UofT, I developed and maintained responsive web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to support AI research. I integrated Flask-based Python backends with real-time data visualization, built APIs to fetch and render AI model outputs, implemented multi-agent Large Language Model pipelines using Python, LangChain and OpenAI API, and collaborated with graduate researchers to design intuitive UI/UX and SQL-backed data storage. I am passionate about building robust, interactive software systems and applying AI-driven solutions to real-world problems.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KaiqiangZheng/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux cluster monitoring system for Jarvis' LCA team using Docker-contained PostgreSQL to store node performance data. Implemented Bash scripts to automate container lifecycle, database table creation, and data insertion from Linux hardware metrics. Scheduled one-minute interval data collection via crontab and conducted manual testing on GCP virtual machines running Rocky Linux 9. Leveraged Git for version control, centralizing monitoring and reducing manual overhead, enabling administrators to efficiently track system performance and resource usage across multiple clusters.


## Highlighted Projects
**SherlockGPT: Root Cause Analysis with Large Language Model ** [[GitHub](https://github.com/KaiqiangZheng1/ECE1786)]: Developed an automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) engine leveraging large language models (GPT-4 via OpenAI API) and prompt engineering to identify incident root causes from cloud system logs and metrics. Designed a multi-agent architecture that iteratively analyzes and ranks potential causes. Utilized the LEMMA-RCA dataset for evaluation, enabling improved incident triage and decision-making efficiency.

**Sentiment Analysis for Customer Service Ticket Analysis** [[GitHub](https://github.com/KaiqiangZheng1/Customer-Sentiment-Analysis)]: Built and deployed a sentiment analysis application in Docker to classify customer service ticket sentiments. Integrated OpenAI¡¯s NLP API for text analysis and Gradio for an interactive web interface, enabling real-time visualization of sentiment trends and improving customer feedback insights.

**Full Stack Semester Project **: Designed and implemented a full-stack web application using Django, Python, and MySQL for backend logic and data management. Built a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Containerized the application with Docker for consistent deployment, demonstrating proficiency in full-stack development and cloud deployment workflows.
