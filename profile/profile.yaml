    description: Developed a Linux cluster monitoring system for Jarvis' LCA team using Docker-contained PostgreSQL to store node performance data. Implemented Bash scripts to automate container lifecycle, database table creation, and data insertion from Linux hardware metrics. Scheduled one-minute interval data collection via crontab and conducted manual testing on GCP virtual machines running Rocky Linux 9. Leveraged Git for version control, centralizing monitoring and reducing manual overhead, enabling administrators to efficiently track system performance and resource usage across multiple clusters.

      - "Grep App: Developed a Java-based application leveraging object-oriented programming principles, designed to function similarly to the Linux grep command. The tool recursively traverses user-specified directories, identifies matches based on user-provided regex patterns, and stores the results in an output file. Java Streams and Lambda expressions were utilized to enhance performance, while Logback was employed for efficient logging. The application was manually tested and debugged using IntelliJ IDEA to ensure reliability. For deployment, a Docker image was created via a custom Dockerfile, with Maven handling dependency management and Git used for version control."

    description: "Delivered data-driven insights for London Gift Shop (LGS), a London-based online retailer, by transforming historical sales data into actionable recommendations. Built a PostgreSQL data warehouse and performed analysis in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) via Jupyter Notebook. Key tasks included tracking monthly sales and customer growth, and applying RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation to support targeted marketing. Ensured reproducibility through Docker containerization and maintained workflow with Git version control."
